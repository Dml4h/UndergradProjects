CSCI 3210

Language Choice
______________

     My language choice for CSCI_3210_Theory is GO; a recently established language created by Google, that has similarities to C language. 

     Although GO is a younger language than the traditional languages like C or JavaScript, it has a bright future not only for itself but for those willing to learn it. I have had a desire to learn this language during my undergrad because it has, I believe it has potential to be a powerhouse in the industry. Willingness to become proficient with GO, even at a beginner's level, shows adaptability, flexibility, and eagerness to evolve with modern languages. There are less jobs requiring GO as a primary language yet the ones that do, tend to pay higher salaries and potentially have more opportunities upon mastery of the language. 


GO Compiler
______________

You have several resources to install a GO compiler or use an online compiler:
	-Online:    		 1) https://play.golang.org/			
	-Local System Compiler:  1) https://golang.org/doc/install
		    		 2) https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/go_environment.htm
