turnin_code:  pp_p2


Write a C program using pthreads to solve the hotplate problem.  The new
program should conform to the same interface as p1 but will have one
extra command-line argument, i.e. the number of threads to use.  It will
continue to print the same values as p1 at each iteration.

To run the program I will type commands like this one:

    ./p2 500 600 100 100 100 400 0.01 8

where the new value 8 represents the number of threads to work on the problem.
Note that 8 would include the main thread, meaning that you would create 7 new
threads to help out.

The expectation is that, for reasonable-sized problems, the program will
get near-linear speed-ups as the number of threads increases.  At the end,
use gettimeofday to print the time spent in the iteration loops *including*
all synchronization operations; but do not count the time for initialization.
The one-line message should say this:

    TOTAL TIME 11.45  ## if 11.45 is the time for all iterations

The original thread should be the one that produces the printed output.

All threads (including the main thread) should participate in the work.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all of your project files,
including a makefile that will build the executable program which MUST
be named p2.
****
Use the -Ofast option to gcc when compiling/building your programs.

****
Use float instead of double because double can double the execution time.

To build the project, I will cd to my directory containing your files
and simply type:

    rm -rf p2
    rm -f *.o
    make
