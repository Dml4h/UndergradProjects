                                   Project 5


turnin code:  awt_p5


Like the demo given in class, create a web page with a number value
that represents the size of a *square* canvas (webgl 2D) to be created.
The size should range between 300 and 900, inclusive, in increments
of 100.  The default value should be 500.  Also, provide a number
value that represents the number of darts to throw at the canvas.
Max/min/incr/default values for this field should be same as the size
field.  Both fields should have a corresponding label to make it easy
to tell them apart.

There should be a button labeled "Run!".  When pressed, it should cause
the canvas to be sized, the square and circle drawn, and all darts thrown
at random locations on the canvas.

The areas inside and outside the circle should be different colors.  Also,
the color for the darts should differ from those used for the square
and circle.  Also, the darts inside the circle should be a different
color from those outside the circle.  Any dart on the circle should be
counted as inside.

Print a value a few lines below the canvas (not on the canvas) that
shows the computation of a value for PI based on the ratio of darts in
and out of the circle, as discussed in class.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all files for the project.

p5 will be graded on www.cs.mtsu.edu in this manner:
    python3 -m http.server --cgi 5994 &   
        ## where 5994 is a port that may change; I will choose the port
        ##   number AT THE TIME OF TESTING

    in chrome on another computer, visit:
        http://www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994    ## 5994 chgd to same port as above

    When I visit that URL, there should be a file there named p5.html
    which I will select to load into the browser.
