Write an MPI C program to solve the hotplate problem.  Because MPI
programs are executed via mpiexec, there will necessarily be a small
change to the method by which programs are run.

BE SURE THAT EVERY RANK DOES THIS:

    alarm(300);

where 300 is a sufficient number of seconds for the rank to do its work.

To run the program I will type commands like this one:

    mpiexec -n 16  ./p5 500 600 100 100 100 400 0.01

where the 16 represents the total number of ranks to use.

Rank 0 should act as a manager process here, thus will not participate in
actual computation.  It will coordinate the activities of the other ranks.
For that reason, you may assume that the number of ranks specified will
never be less than 2.
Rank 0 should also produce all printed output.
Produce the same output at power-of-2 iterations as in earlier versions
of the project.
And also print the TOTAL TIME line when finished.  Note you can get time
via MPI_Wtime() now.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all of your project files,
including a makefile that will build the executable program which MUST
be named p5.  Note that I only type the simple command "make" below in
order to have the program built.

    rm -rf p5
    rm -f *.o
    make
