A single webpage using webworkers to examine a range of integers(inclusive).
The square root of each integer is calculated. If the first digit after the 
decimal point is 7, the integer is included in the total count.
    For example:
        127.677  # would NOT be counted
        123.766  # would be counted ****


The UI allows the user to input values in the range from 1 to 4 which 
represents the number of threads that should be used to compute the result.  
The "main" thread does not participate in computing
the result.When computation is complete, information about
the results and the threads involved in the computation is printed out.
Example:
    2 threads compute range: 111000 999000
    Output
        THREAD1: 44455     
        THREAD2: 44323
        TOTAL:  88778     
        TIME 12.345678
