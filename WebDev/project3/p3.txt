This project demonstrates client/s4rver communication by using
websockets to establish a websocket connection to a server 
written in Python.
p3.js establishes a websocket connection to a serverP3 which
provides the current values of candidate info in votecnts.txt file and
it can also ask the server to update the contents of the file.

The current vote counts is kept in a file named: votecnts.txt

Your main dir should contain a file named:
    reset_votecnts.sh
It should reset the votecnts.txt file to 0 for both candidates.
I will execute it by typing this:
    sh reset_votecnts.sh

To set up server, run make.
To run: 
    start 2 servers
        python3 -m http.server --cgi 3000 &
        ./serverP3 &
    visit:
        sc http:/localhost:3000/p3.html
