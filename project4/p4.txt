Write a python3 program that uses the multiprocessing module to examine a
range of integers *inclusive*.  For each integer, compute its square root
and then determine if the first digit after the decimal point is 7.
For example:
    127.677  # would NOT be counted
    123.766  # would be counted ***

Converting to a string and looking at the first char after . is probably
an UN-acceptably slow way to examine each one; use a little arithmetic.

The program will be run using 3 command-line arguments like this:

    python3 p4.py  2000 30000  1
    python3 p4.py  1000 10000  3

The first and second args are the range of ints to be examined, inclusive.
The third arg is the number of processes to use to do the computation.

Note that you only count the total number of ints that match the criteria;
you do not need to keep the matching numbers.

Use the Process facility of the multiprocessing module to create the
worker processes.  Use the Queue facility of the multiprocessing module
to retrieve the results from the worker processes.

The mainline program should NOT perform any of the computation.
Instead, it should merely start the workers, wait for their results, and
then print the final result.

Use the time.time facility in the mainline to determine the amount of time
between immediately prior to the worker processes being "start"ed and 
immediately after they are "join"ed.
Print the time to 2 decimal places.

The print should contain EXACTLY 1 LINE OF OUTPUT containing these values:
    the total time
    the total number of integers matching the criteria

For example, these runs might produce *roughly* these prints on system64:

    python3 p4.py 1000 100000 1
        0.05 9918

    python3 p4.py 1000 1000000 1
        0.51 100001

    python3 p4.py 1000 11000000 1
        4.23 1099818

    python3 p4.py 1000 11000000 2
        2.53 1099818

    python3 p4.py 1000 11000000 3
        1.81 1099818

    python3 p4.py 1000 11000000 4
        1.04 1099818

So, speedup would be near-linear for large enough problems.


BE SURE TO HAVE THIS AS THE FIRST EXECUTABLE CODE IN YOUR PROGRAM:

    import signal
    signal.alarm(120)
