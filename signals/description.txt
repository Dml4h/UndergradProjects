BE SURE TO HAVE THIS AS THE FIRST EXECUTABLE LINE IN YOUR PROGRAM:

    alarm(90);


Write a program that loops doing:

    sleep(1);


On receiving SIGINT, the program should print the following message
and continue to execute:

    received SIGINT

On receiving SIGUSR1, the program should print the following message
and continue to execute:

    received SIGUSR1

However, when the program has received a total of 4 SIGUSR1 signals,
it should terminate after printing this message:

    terminating due to 4 SIGUSR1 signals

On receiving SIGUSR2 (2 instead of 1), the program should print the
following message and terminate immediately:

    received SIGUSR2


As in prior projects, if the program is run with a single command-line arg
of  -hw  then it should simply  print hello world   and then  exit(0)

To run program: run make
