turnin_code:  pp_p4


Write an MPI C program that provides the following functionality.

BE SURE THAT EVERY RANK DOES an alarm first, e.g.:
    
    alarm(180);

where 180 is a sufficient number of seconds for your rank to complete
its work.

To run the program I will type commands like this one:

    mpiexec -n 16  ./p4

where the 16 represents the number of ranks to use.

Rank 0 should merely act as a manager process here.  It should retrieve
from each of the other ranks, the hostname and hostid where that rank
is running.  Rank 0 should print the results sorted by rank, including
information about its own hostname and hostid.  Depending on where the
ranks run, rank 0 would print something like this:

    0  c00  2da1c8a2
    1  c03  2da1cba2
    2  c06  2da1cea2


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all of your project files,
including a makefile that will build the executable program which MUST
be named p4.  Note that I only type the simple command "make" below in
order to have the program built.

    rm -rf p4
    rm -f *.o
    make
