Write an MPI C program that provides the following functionality.

To run the program, type commands like:

    mpiexec -n 16  ./p4

where the 16 represents the number of ranks to use.

Rank 0 should merely act as a manager process here.  It should retrieve
from each of the other ranks, the hostname and hostid where that rank
is running.  Rank 0 should print the results sorted by rank, including
information about its own hostname and hostid.  Depending on where the
ranks run, rank 0 would print something like this:

    0  c00  2da1c8a2
    1  c03  2da1cba2
    2  c06  2da1cea2
