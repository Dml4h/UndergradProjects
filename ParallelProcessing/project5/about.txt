Write an MPI C program to solve the hotplate problem.  Because MPI
programs are executed via mpiexec, there will necessarily be a small
change to the method by which programs are run.

To run the program, type commands like:

    mpiexec -n 16  ./p5 500 600 100 100 100 400 0.01  //16 is number ranks to use

Rank 0 should act as a manager process here,  will not participate in
computation, will coordinate the activities of the other ranks, and
produces all printed output.And also print the TOTAL TIME line when finished.
